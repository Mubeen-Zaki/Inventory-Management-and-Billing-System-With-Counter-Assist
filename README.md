# Inventory Management and Billing System with Counter Assist

## Description

Inventory Management and Billing System with Counter Assist is a Java application built using Java Swing, designed to efficiently manage inventory and generate GST-calculated bills. It provides a user-friendly interface for businesses to keep track of their stock, generate bills for purchased items, and assist cashiers in managing currency notes during transactions.

## Features

- **Inventory Management:** The application allows users to maintain a database of inventory items, including their names, quantities, and prices. Users can add, edit, and delete items as needed.

- **GST Calculated Billing:** When customers make purchases, the application automatically calculates the bill amount, including the applicable Goods and Services Tax (GST). This feature ensures accurate billing and adherence to tax regulations.

- **Bill Generation and Download:** Users can generate itemized bills for each transaction, including details such as item name, quantity, price, and GST amount. The generated bills can be downloaded and printed for customer records.

- **Currency Notes Management:** The system assists cashiers in managing currency notes during transactions. Users can input the number of different currency notes tendered by the customer, and the application calculates the change to be returned, along with the cash available after the transaction.

- **Currency Notes Breakdown:** The application provides a breakdown of the currency notes to be given to the customer as change. This helps cashiers streamline the process and minimize errors during transactions.

## Tech Stack

The project leverages the following technologies:

- Java: The core programming language used for building the application's logic and functionality.

- Java Swing: The graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit for Java, used to create the interactive and user-friendly interface.

- MySQL Database: The project utilizes a MySQL database to store and manage inventory data and transaction details.

- Apache NetBeans IDE: The Integrated Development Environment used for coding, debugging, and building the Java application. Apache NetBeans provides a user-friendly environment for Java development.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub.
2. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
3. Set up a MySQL database with appropriate tables to store inventory and transaction data.
4. Update the database connection details in the application code to connect to your MySQL database.
5. Open the project in Apache NetBeans IDE.
6. Compile and run the Java application.

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, follow these steps to use the Inventory Management and Billing System:

1. Access the inventory management page to add, edit, or delete items from the inventory.
2. When a customer makes a purchase, navigate to the billing page to generate a GST-calculated bill.
3. Download and print the bill for the customer if required.
4. On the currency notes management page, input the number of currency notes tendered by the customer.
5. The application will display the change to be returned, along with the cash available after the transaction.
6. Check the currency notes breakdown to determine the denominations of notes to be given as change to the customer.
